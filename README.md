# HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are categorized into several classes:

1. [Informational responses (100 - 199)](#informational-responses)
2. [Successful responses (200 - 299)](#successful-responses)
3. [Redirection messages (300 - 399)](#redirection-messages)
4. [Client error responses (400 - 499)](#client-error-responses)
5. [Server error responses (500 - 599)](#server-error-responses)

## Informational Responses

### 100 Continue

- **Meaning:** The initial part of the request was received, and the client should proceed with the rest of the request or ignore the response.
- **Usage:** Allows the server to inform the client to continue with the request.

### 101 Switching Protocols

- **Meaning:** The server is switching protocols as requested by the client's `Upgrade` header.
- **Usage:** Typically used when upgrading from HTTP to a different protocol like WebSocket.

### 102 Processing (WebDAV)

- **Meaning:** The server has received the request and is processing it, but no response is available yet.
- **Usage:** Prevents client timeouts during long processing times.

### 103 Early Hints

- **Meaning:** Provides early information to the client about resources that will be needed for the requested page.
- **Usage:** Allows preloading or preconnecting resources while the server prepares a response.

## Successful Responses

- **Usage:** Various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) can result in a 200 response indicating success.

### 201 Created

- **Meaning:** The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
- **Usage:** Typically follows a POST request that creates a new resource.

### 202 Accepted

- **Meaning:** The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
- **Usage:** Used when the outcome is uncertain or handled by another process.

### 203 Non-Authoritative Information

- **Usage:** Commonly used in caching scenarios where a mirror or backup server responds.

### 204 No Content

- **Usage:** Instructs the client to clear the form used for submitting data.

### 206 Partial Content

- **Meaning:** The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.
- **Usage:** Used when the client requests only a portion of a resource.

### 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)

- **Meaning:** Provides status for multiple independent operations on different resources.
- **Usage:** Commonly used in WebDAV operations.

### 208 Already Reported (WebDAV)

- **Meaning:** The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to the same request.
- **Usage:** Avoids repeating the same resource listing in WebDAV responses.

### 226 IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)

- **Meaning:** The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, applying one or more instance manipulations.
- **Usage:** Used in HTTP Delta encoding scenarios.
